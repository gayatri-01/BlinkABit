  <p>We all blink. A lot. The average person blinks some 15-20 times per minuteâ€”so frequently that our eyes are closed for roughly 10% of our waking hours overall.As we stare at the computer screen or while reading, our blink rate decreases. We actually blink 66% less while working on the computer. This will cause your eyes to feel dry and to burn</p>
